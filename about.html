    <h1>About Me</h1>

    About Me 
    Born and raised in Utah except for a few 6 month stays in other states, and an 8 month stay in Tonga, where my dad was born, this is my home state. I love the mountains and the beautiful scenery surrounding this city. My family spends a lot of time outdoors camping, riding ATV’s and chasing the sun for family adventures. I’m married with kids. Our family has one bad dog, a crazy kitten and a whole lotta love and laundry between the lot of us. 
    I was a super fortunate, High Schooler and snagged a great job when I was a Junior. I started working for AT&T when I was 17.  By the time I was 19, I was putting a downpayment on my first house. After I had worked for AT&T for 6 years, my hubby and I sold our house, cashed out the equity and moved to St. George, Utah. 
    I attended Dixie College, after a name change last year, it’s now called Utah Tech. I earned my Associate of Arts degree, from Utah Tech. I originally wanted to go into nursing but once I found out how much bodily fluids were involved with a nursing career, I quickly U-turned back to Salt Lake. 
    In the spring of 2007, I was hired at Fidelity Investments, as a customer service representative. At the time I didn’t know what a mutual fund was. This job was the beginning of a very educational career.

    2007, what a time to work in the financial industry. At the time money markets were paying 5% interest and S&P 500 was trading at 1444 points. An article from June of 2007, published by CNN Money, stated “Don’t sweat the selloff” the market hit an S&P high on Monday. The writer of this article pointed to consumer worry about economic growth, inflation and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Sounds like current stock market concerns for 2023. During this time, I was working full-time. Fidelity was requesting 20% weekly overtime and demanding at least 10% from every employee. It was an incredibly tough time that lasted a year and half. As with all hard times, to survive you dig deep, bring some tasty snacks and work diligently. Fun facts to consider in 2006 the S&P was up almost 16%, 2007 the S&P ended positive with 5% but the beginning of the biggest downturn in the last 100 years had already been showing signs of the doom to come in 2008. In 2008 the S&P lost 37% and was heart breaking and miserable for majority of investors. The lowest the S&P traded during the downturn was 676 points.

    After I had been at Fidelity for several years, I realized there’s so much more than stock and mutual fund trading. Although it was very exciting being able to place investment trades it was also very rigid, and no room for errors. I have placed some very memorable trades like buying 2 shares of Berkshire Hathaway, class A shares, when the stock was trading at little over $100k per share. The client bought two shares at the time and if he held them as of today, they’d be worth $462,435. I was able to attend Westminster College in Salt Lake, Utah and attained my Bachelors Degree in Business Administration.

    Why did I share this? I wanted to tell you that I have done incredibly hard and mostly responsible things throughout my lifetime. Challenge is something that comes to into most peoples lives. I’ve been through many challenging times and sometimes the only thing that gets you through is courage, coffee and good teammates. I’m new to the Tech field but I’m going to bring my devotion to learning, my dedication and solid work ethic to any company I work for. I hope you drop me a line and say hello. 
    Thanks and take care, 
    Elisabeth Vawdrey (Betsy is what you can call me)
