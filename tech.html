    How the internet really works….. It’s not magic, or is it? 
        Wire that transfers data and files
        <div></div>
    Server is a 24 hr (giant library) serves you requested data
    <div></div>
    1st Browser sends the requested message. Web browsers translate content in various ways. Chrome and Safari can take the same content and it will appear different in each browser. Sort of like spoken language from different regions. 
    <div></div>2nd ISP = Internet Service Provider
    <div></div>3rd DNS: Phone Book, exact IP address
    <P>
        Internet: 
    The backbone of the Internet is underwater cables to really reach shore to shore. The inside of the cables are glass fiber optics protected by heavy duty casing.  
    </P>
    <p>
    Websites:
    <div></div>
    Tools used in creating Websites: 
    Front End development of websites use these building blocks to show what a user sees when they click on a website. 
    HTML: words and commands used to create structure of a website. (Text, Images) Open and close tags are used here to separate content. 
    CSS: Style and display for HTML used to make things appear the way you want. (Styling, Fonts, Colors, Positioning)  
    Java Script: Takes the HTML and CSS, like a machine, combines the HTML and CSS together to make the items behave in a certain way. 
    Coding languages: Java, Java Script, Python, C, C++, multiple languages to use. 
    Document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>   
    Basic HTML and HTML 5: structural content not functional content, the internet languages make the content functional. 
    Basic HTML: a standard mark-up language for creating structure to documents on webpages using elements and tags.
    HTML 5: takes basic HTML and makes it more descriptive. Been the standard since 2008.
    Tags, Main, Header, Footer, NAV, Video, Article, Section
    <li>Elements: words inside a tag that control an elements behavior.
    <element attribute=”value”>element content</element> (Wikipedia.org) </li>
    
    Tags: are the name of the element surrounded by angle brackets
    Attributes: Rules or standards that get applied to text 
    
    Values: open
    Links: connections to other websites
        Open Tags: <h1> Closing tags </h1> forward slash is the only difference. 
        <P> element is preferred paragraph text for websites but there are other choices to
        <body> 
        <head> information for the document
        <header> sets apart the section of the document.
        <main> specifies primary content of the document.
    <img src=”url of image” alt =” simple title of image” > Image doesn’t have a closing tab
    a<anchor element> link content outside of webpage. a elements need a destination address called an href. <a href = “https://www.freecodecamp.org”?> is a link outside of the current webpage and directs you to the href site. <“#footer”> 
    (to create an internal link within the website assign the href a #, plus the value of an element.)
    unordered lists and list items (words displayed within the unordered list: <ul> <li> </ul> 
    ordered lists: <ol> <li> </ol>
    line breaks:<br> blank space, <hr> horizontal line, <div> divider 
     
        
        h1 elements are often main headings (most important) biggest meaning and display. 
        h2 elements are subheadings. 
        h3 through h6 are different levels of subheadings. 
    
    CSS
    Fonts that are universal: Tahoma, Sanserif, Cursive these can be used as a fall back. 
    
    CSS class selectors: 
    Color wheel: 	
    # HEX: 6-digit value that displays a percent of 3 primary colors. 							F= a lot of color, 0 is equal to none
        RGB: 3 primary colors (Red, Green, Blue) displayed by sets of three numbers from (0-255)
            255= highest color, 0 is none example: (255, 245, 35)
