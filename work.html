    <h2 it too late to start? Never!</h2>
<div> </div>
        Where to Start? 
        <li>
•	1st Emergency funds! $1000, then a month, then 3 months. In Tech it’s totally recommended to have 6 months of emergency funds.</li> 
<li>
•	2nd ax out your 401k. Max contribution is $22,500, catch-up is $7500 for 50 and older. Total contributions for employees & employer are $66,000. 
</li>
<li>
•	3rd IRA & Roth: watch the income limits. </li>
<li>
•	4th Annuities are dead LAST! But get sold first because the seller gets paid a high fee…Please beware.</li>
<p> 
What happens if I never save……. Medicaid & Low-Income housing or living with a family member. It’s getting more common to see friends or family bunking up and living in the same space for retirement.
What happens if I save………You’ll have more options, Medicare, SSI and IRA/401k savings. Everyone’s favorite Taxes- you will have to pay taxes. </p>

<p>
Investment types, starting with the most conservative. 
There’s no magic investment fund with no risk and 8%+ steady returns. If you can’t lose it don’t invest it. 
<li>
•	Cash: minimal growth, minimal risk of loss</li>
<li>
o	Example: $1000 for 5 yrs at .75% compounded annually would give you $1038.00 </li>
<li> 
•	CD’s & Money Markets: </li>
<li>
o	Example: $1000 for 5 yrs at 4% compounded annually would give you $1217.00</li>
<li>
•	Stocks: Owning a piece of a company, set at a variable price that will fluctuate every market day…all throughout the trading day. Exceptional growth but risk is all the way down to zero. 
</li>
<li>
•	Mutual Funds: the most common investment offered in all 401K’s. The options are selected by your employer. 
</li>
<li>•	Bonds: You give your money over for a set time and then you get a guarantee of return. There’s risk with time and if you don’t stick to the agreement of time… you’re penalized with loss of guarantee. The simplest way to invest here is through mutual funds. Real bond trading is still done the old-fashioned way…with cigar smoking and sipping brandy in a fancy lounge. 
</li>
<li>•	Employee Stock Options: right to buy at a set price or shares granted to an employee at a certain time (vested shares). 

</li>

<p>Investment Return Examples for Mutual Fund Blended Returns
Example: 

	If you invested $1000, with 4% growth yearly, would be $1217.00. 
Longer term amts 1 yr. at $217 x 5 = $1085 + 1000 = $2085.00 after 5 yrs. 
(Looked at the 40% stock fund: 3 yr: +3.2, 5 yr: +3.8, 10 yr: +5.2……. current yr loss -6% actual returns as of 02/28/2023)
	Looked at 70% stock fund: 3 yr: + 5.8, 5 yr: 5.2, 10 yr: 7.59%.... current yr loss -7.5% (actual fund return as of 02/28/2023) 
	Example: $1000.00 at 3 yr = $1,099.00, at 5 yr= $1205.00, at 10 yr = $1629.00

Buyer Beware of people who make you feel scared….or urged into investments like your time is gone and there’s no chance if you don’t act now. Ask how they are compensated; this is not rude it is a requirement. 
Big companies are a safe bet, highly regulated and more transparent. 
<div>
Small boutique firms are scary- please do your research. Do not invest unless you understand the fees and how you can access your money. Small firms have less regulation and if the company has under 100 million, they don’t have to register for certain things with the Securities Exchange Committee. 
</div>
Things to ask a small firm:
<li>How are you compensated, please show me the actual math…fees in writing from my actual balance.</li> 
<li>Make sure you’re getting regular statements.</li> 			
<li>In an emergency how fast can you have cash in hand.</li> 
<li>Warning: Utah is the first state to create a website dedicated to fraudsters……. why? </li>
<div></div>
Please check: Utah’s Financial Safety Net, Stop Fraud in Utah, SEC.Gov/ check your investment Advisor. 
Accreditation matters: licensing, rules, fiduciaries, CFP’s do not just hand your hard-earned money over.

<li>Bernie Madoff biggest Ponzi scheme roughly 65 billion </li>
<li>Enron: 2001 energy company bankrupt with a loss of 78 billion.</li>
<li>
Lehman Brothers: 600 billion failed Investment Bank spark of 2008 downturn </li>
<li>WorldCom: 2002 Tech Downturn </li> 
<div></div>
How much do I need? 
It’s debatable here’s some opinions.
<div></div>
<li>Somewhere between 8 to 12 times your annual salary before you retire. (Fidelity)</li>
<li>25 times your annual income need (Forbes)</li>
<div></div> 
Example: Want $100k. SSI would give you $25k so you need to come up with $75k. 
You take 25 multiplied by $75,000 = $1,875,000. Is the amt you need before retirement, is it even possible?    
(All the calculations I used NerdWallet’s, free, compound interest calculator.)
<div></div>
Math scenarios: 100k initial investment, $500 monthly, monthly compounding at 8% for 25 years = $1,209,531. Remember you can save up to $22,500 here for a tax deduction.  
$50,000 initial investment, $1000 a month, 25 years at 6% monthly compounding = $916,242.
<div></div> 
<li>
$0 initial contribution, $500 monthly, 25 yrs at 4% = $257,065.</li>
<li> 
$0 initial contribution, $250 monthly, 25 yrs at 4% = $128,532</li>
<div></div>
Please save, if you don’t care about your money…it’s likely no one else will either.  
How much will you need to spend? 
<div></div>
Depends on what your SSI, pension or regular income will be…you’ll need to supplement the difference. 
<li>Retirement Age per Social Security Administration: </li>
<li>62 is early retirement.</li>
<li>67 is regular retirement. </li>
<li>70 is full retirement benefit for your whole life…… do the math it matters. </li>	
Longevity, personal health.

Investment Portfolio Blends
<li>
•	Ultra Conservative: minimal growth, no risk of loss. </li>
<li>•	Conservative: 20% Stocks, 80% bonds</li> 
<li>•	Mid-level: 30%-40% stocks, 50%-60% bonds</li>
<li>•	Balanced: 50%-60% stocks, 50-40% bonds: this is a sweet spot for a lot of folks, set it & forget it.</li>
<li>•	Growth: 70% stocks, 30% bonds- this is riskier but more rewarding</li>
<li>•	Aggressive: 80% (+) this is majority stock with little buffer but some padding</li>
<li>•	Aggressive Growth: 100% stock and riding the wave of the market.</li> 
<div></div>
Indexes: weighting of stocks have to do with Market Cap 
<div></div>
Dow Jones: DJIA, 30 (Industrial) F, AMZN, BAC, PFE, T, UNP- not all inclusive  
<div></div> 
S&P 500: sort of the best gauge 500 Large Cap companies…hard part all companies are not weighted the same. META, BAC, WBD (Warner Bro), Carnival (CCL), PG&E
<div></div>
Nasdaq: 3700 Large Cap Companies (Trading Platform as of 2006) also an Index: Tesla, AMZN, InTel, AAPL, Alphabet, MSFT

The same stocks can be in the same indexes, it’s just a different number of stocks per index.
